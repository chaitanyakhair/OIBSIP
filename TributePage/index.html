<h3><b><p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (audio speaker iconlisten); 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was</p>
   <p>an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was </p>
   <p>born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent</p>
   <p>the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and</p>
   <p>Development Organisation(DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately </p>
   <p>involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus</p>
   <p>came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile</p>
   <p>and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political</p> 
   <p>role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India</p>
   <p>in 1974.<p></p>

   <p>Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya</p>
    <p>Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",</p>
      <p>he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a</p> 
        <p>recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.</p>
  
          <p>While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from</p>
            <p>an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level dignitaries,</p>
              <p>attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state</p>
                <p>honours.</p>
